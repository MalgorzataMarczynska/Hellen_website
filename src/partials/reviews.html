            In a short time with Elena, I mastered grammmar and replenished my
            completely empty vocabulary. From the first lesson I realized that I
            was on my plate. Elena and I became friends because she was really
            worried about my success. She became an authority for me, but I did
            not tremble in class, fearing to make the slightest mistake. Now I
            can brag that I'm student...

            The Hellen language school I've been attending for several months
            has been a tremendous help in improving my language fluency.
            Initially, I struggled with comprehension and speaking in English,
            but now I feel much more confident. Conversations with teacher and
            fellow students have truly assisted me in practicing speaking.
            However, I am still working on improving my accent...

            My experience with Elena has resulted in a significant expansion of
            my vocabulary. She regularly introduce new words and idioms that are
            later practiced in various contexts. As a result, my English
            vocabulary has greatly broadened. For example, recently, we learned
            the expression "barking up the wrong tree," which means looking for
            something in the wrong place. However...

            This is a place where I truly grasped the most challenging grammar
            rules. Elena always take the time to explain complex concepts, which
            has been immensely helpful. An example of a difficult rule I
            understood is the use of the third conditional sentence. The school
            also offers plenty of practical exercises that allow me to solidify
            these challenging rules. This place genuinely prioritizes...
